# üö® URGENT: DNS WordPress.com Migration Fix

**Issue:** `midastechnical.com` is showing Netlify 404 instead of WordPress.com
**Status:** DNS configuration needs immediate correction
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## üîç **Problem Analysis**

The domain `midastechnical.com` is currently pointing to Netlify instead of WordPress.com, causing a 404 error. This indicates that either:

1. DNS records are not properly configured for WordPress.com
2. DNS propagation is still in progress
3. WordPress.com site is not properly set up
4. Domain connection in WordPress.com is incomplete

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Immediate Fix Steps**

### **Step 1: DNS Configuration Analysis ‚úÖ CORRECT**

**Current DNS Status:**
```
midastechnical.com A records:
- 192.0.78.159 ‚úÖ (WordPress.com)
- 192.0.78.224 ‚úÖ (WordPress.com)
```

**Issue Identified:** DNS is correctly pointing to WordPress.com, but the WordPress.com site hasn't been created yet. The 404 error is coming from WordPress.com, not Netlify (the server header was misleading).

### **Step 2: Create WordPress.com Site üö® CRITICAL**

**Immediate Action Required:**

1. **Access WordPress.com Dashboard**
   ```
   URL: https://wordpress.com/
   Action: Login to your WordPress.com account
   ```

2. **Create New Site**
   - Click "Create a new site" or "Add new site"
   - Choose domain: `midastechnical.com`
   - Select plan: Commerce (should already be purchased)
   - Choose theme: Business/E-commerce theme

3. **Connect Custom Domain**
   - Go to: My Sites ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí General
   - Add custom domain: `midastechnical.com`
   - Verify domain ownership
   - WordPress.com will detect the correct A records

### **Step 3: Alternative Quick Fix - Subdomain Setup**

If the main domain setup is complex, create a temporary subdomain:

1. **Create WordPress.com Subdomain**
   ```
   Suggested: midastechnical.wordpress.com
   ```

2. **Test Site Creation**
   - Verify the subdomain works
   - Import homepage template
   - Set up basic structure

3. **Point Main Domain Later**
   - Once subdomain site is working
   - Connect `midastechnical.com` to the working site

### **Step 4: Verify WordPress.com Account Status**

**Check Account Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ WordPress.com account exists
- ‚úÖ Commerce plan is active
- ‚ùì Domain is properly added to account
- ‚ùì Site is created and published

**Account Verification Steps:**
1. Login to WordPress.com
2. Check "My Sites" - should show midastechnical.com
3. Verify Commerce plan is active
4. Check domain settings
